                details: "Counting was originally made as a clone of the most popular counting bot, counting#5250 made by Duck and tt2468. I was cloning counting#5250 because It was (and still is) missing the levels of customization options that I wanted and I thought I could make a better version of it. Counting originally launched on January 17th, 2020 for a few friends and was not taken to seriously, on Jun 27, 2020 the original bot was deleted and re-launched on June 27th, 2020, the relaunched version I took seriously. I started working on unique features that users asked for, taking the project from a clone to its own unique product.",

                details: "Counting was a big project because when I started I did not have a lot experience with the programs that were required. As time went on and I made improvements, I ended up learning a ton. I learnt all about databases, optimized code, front end development, core programming concepts, server clustering, and the list goes on. Almost everything I know about code development has been learnt because of this bot in some way.",

When I took up this project I did not think it would turn out to be anything special, three years later I am still amazed at the stats every time I look at them.",
